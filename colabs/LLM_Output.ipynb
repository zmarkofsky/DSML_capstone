I am glad that he is finding the Beta project and all its applications to be so interesting and exciting. I will let him know we appreciate the effort he puts in but sometimes it is a little too much when we just need supporting facts for the report. If you are okay with it, I will show him some of your recent reports to coach on how they should be written so he has a better idea of what to include so there is not rework to be had. I would suggest working on the report together so you can discuss the amazing ways that the Beta project can be used so he isn't as inclined to include that in the report. We will discuss his goal of getting promoted to lead engineer and what steps he can take to ensure he gets where he wants. I would like to hear his thoughts on how the Beta project can be utilized across more areas and possibly how to incorporate them. Since he is so enthusiastic about the new technology we may be able to bring him on to work on new applications instead of just the reports. I will let you know how it goes. Please keep me informed of the progress. Thank you!\",\n          \"Hi Jonathan, I wanted to reach out to thank you for all of your work on the Beta project! It sounds like you are working well with the team and doing a great job of identifying some needed improvements! Today, I would like to discuss your reports. I've looked over the last few and identified a couple of areas of improvement, specifically around the extra commentary that was included and the accuracy/organization. The Beta project is extremely important and if it fails, many of us could lose our jobs. For that reason, I would like for you to collaborate with Terry when creating your reports so that we can ensure that they are in line with what is expected. I know that this is a new project for you and I'm sure you are excited, but also a little overwhelmed. Terry will help support you through this learning curve and you will be up to speed in no time. Can you give me your commitment that you will work through this with him? Thank you for your support, William\",\n          \"Hello Jonathan, How are you?

Well, I had the opportunity to review of your technical report which was very impressive interms of techinal information contained, however, ascorporate we need, to be morealigned in the format. We need to include all relevant technical information butat he same time we need to propose in a clear, professional and concise form.I am planning to send a report from my end that you can consider as a reference and feel free to share your draft next time in order to me to highlight improvement opportunity in your report style.
